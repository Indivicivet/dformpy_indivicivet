## Python Library for differential forms

This Python library deals with differential forms. It gives an interactive visualization of the differential forms and their calculus such as exterior derivative, interior derivative, wedge product and the Hodge star operation, and helps understand their geometric meaning. The library also plots contravariant vector fields and their different geometric structure such as gradient, divergence, curl and inner products between covariant and contravariant vectors.
