## Python GUI for differential forms

This project aims at building a Python library for differential forms that gives an interactive visualization of the differential forms and their calculus such as exterior derivative, wedge product and Hodge operator, and helps understand their geometric meaning. The library will also be capable of plotting contravariant vector fields and visualizing different geometric structure such as gradient, divergence, curl and inner products between covariant and contravariant vectors. We aim at showing via graphical interface that differential forms are the natural object that should be used to describe fields and visualize their characteristics in different dimensions.

Differential forms are the mathematical language used in most of modern theoretical Physics. Applications such as electromagnetic 2-forms, Lorentz force, Maxwellâ€™s equations and radiation fields will be investigated using the library.

This project is mainly computational and requires strong knowledge and experience in Python coding and using Python libraries. The analytical part of the project requires learning about differential forms and some practice with exterior calculus. Building a library for visualizing differential forms will be very useful for the geometrical understanding of the topic and its applications especially in the context of relativity.
